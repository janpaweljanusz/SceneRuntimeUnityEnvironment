# Decentraland Scene Runtime Environment
Unity of Decentraland scene runtime environment

The program embeds a JavaScript runtime basic functions to execute them in a sandboxed environment written in Unity ECS application.
It provides access to functionality outside the sandbox with a bridge between JavaScript functions and C# environment. 
It is a simplified version of a minimal Decentraland scene runtime.


# Features

## Basic functionality

1. Create a game environment with ECS-like functionality (adding entities, attaching components, and updating data).
2. Load the test file in the sandboxed environment 
3. Establish a bidirectional channel between the game and sanboxed environments.
4. Correctly render and animate a cube according to the scriptâ€™s instructions.
5. Provide keyboard input from the game engine to the script.
6. Provide keyboard input from the game engine to the script.

# Usage
run from the root of your project:
``` $ ./bin/run ```

## Requirements 
The project run in a Windows 10 shell environment with dotnet and .NET 6 installed.
